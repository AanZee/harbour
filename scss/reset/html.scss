1. NOTE
Makes sure its children can use complete height of the html element as minimum height and set a sticky footer if needed.
Use 'height'. Do not use 'min-height' because this will break functionality. Don't know why.
Use '100%'. Do not use '100vh' because this will **always** create scroll bars in iOS Safari and other mobile webbrowsers.
In iOS Safari and other mobile browsers 100vh = viewport height without bars = scrollbars with viewport with bars.
Also as a result '100%' makes sure the bars on mobile webbrowsers are forced when no scrollbars are needed.
